# Secure Notes Application

Welcome to the Secure Notes Application repository! This project focuses on building a secure note-taking application using C# and Windows Forms. The application provides a login system and utilizes encryption techniques to store user information securely either locally or on a server. This project aims to explore various aspects of cybersecurity while providing a practical and user-friendly note-taking solution.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: The application includes a login system to authenticate users before accessing their secure notes.

2. **Note Creation and Management**: Once authenticated, users can create, view, edit, and delete their secure notes within the application.

3. **Encryption and Security**: The application employs encryption algorithms to secure user data, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. User information is protected from unauthorized access or tampering.

4. **Local or Server Storage**: Users have the option to store their secure notes locally on their device or on a remote server. This allows for flexibility and scalability based on user preferences.

## Technologies Used

The Secure Notes Application is primarily developed using the following technologies:

- **C#**: The main programming language used to implement the application logic and user interface using Windows Forms.

- **.NET Framework**: The application leverages the .NET Framework for its robust development environment and access to libraries that provide security and encryption functionalities.

- **Cryptography Libraries**: Built-in cryptographic libraries in C# such as `System.Security.Cryptography` are utilized to handle encryption and decryption operations.

- **Database (Optional)**: If you choose to store data on a server, a suitable database system such as MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server can be integrated to handle data storage and retrieval.
